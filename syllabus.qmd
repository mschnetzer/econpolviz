#### Course design

The lecturer introduces into the principles of data visualization with applications in economic policy. As the graphic illustration of statistical data gains in importance in both the academic and the public discourse, students will learn best practices and gain insights into visualization techniques. A large part of each session is dedicated to the work with data, where the lecturer provides R-code to produce figures in class.

Studens are expected to recreate three charts at home at the beginning of the semester and create a comprehensive data visualization with exclusive data from the Austrian Patent Office. Studens will present their chart in class and draft a report with a detailed description of the data, the code and the final visualization in RMarkdown. Moreover, the best charts are awarded by the Austrian Patent Office.

The sessions are designed to encourage students to actively participate in the debates, raise questions, and gain experience in visualizing data for academic publications or the general debate.
