    "text": "Data visualization\nThe Austrian Patent Office will exclusively provide internal data to create data visualizations and illustrate the process of private innovation in Austria. You will be able to select a topic and obtain a ready-made dataset from the agency. You have to create a preliminary chart for a presentation in one of the two final sessions. The presentation should contain the research question, an intuition of the underlying data and, most important, your considerations behind the style of the chart. Your time slot for the presentation is five minutes. Afterwards we will have a brief Q&A in class together with an evaluation of the lecturer and representatives of the Patent Office. The presentation should only have a small number of slides with little text to lead the audience through the process of chart creation, e.g.\n\nResearch question: What do you want to answer with your chart?\nData: What data did you use?\nChart: What does the chart show? What were your thoughts when choosing this style?\n\nPlease also carefully read the accompanying information document provided by the Austrian Patent Office: \n\n\nRMarkdown report\nStudents are required to draft a short report around the chart, containing the most important information of chart creation and the entire R code. The final version of the report is due on January 31, 2024. You should work with RMarkdown which is a handy and simple tool to compose reports based on R code. It is recommended to edit the document in RStudio. The final report will be an HTML file and should be structured as follows:\n\nResearch question: What is the specific research question that you want to address with your visualization?\nData: What data was available and what did you actually use? If helpful, you might want to include some descriptive statistics as a table.\nResult: Present and describe the chart that you have created.\nConclusion: What are the main conclusions from your chart?\nCode: Provide the full code for your data visualization as a code block in the appendix of the report.\n\nThe charts and the report will be published under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license. The Austrian Patent Office will be authorized to (re-)use and edit visualizations and code for non-commercial purposes.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      #\n      Topic\n      Source\n      Categories\n      Contact\n    \n  \n  \n    1\nR&D quota\nEurostat\nTime and country comparison\n\n\n    2\nR&D expenditures per million inhabitants\nEurostat\nTime and country comparison\n\n\n    3\nR&D financing sources\nStatAT\nFinancing sources (sectors), time\n\n\n    4\nInnovation Investments\nOECD\ndifferent asset forms, AT and EU (over time)\n\n\n    5\nInnovation - European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) - 12 Pillars\nEC\n12 pillars and country comparison (over time)\n\n\n    6\nInnovation - European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) - pillar: Intellectual Assets\nEC\nPillar: Intellectual Asstes (3.3); 3 Subindicators, time and country comparsion\n\n\n    7\nNational Property Rights\nÖPA\n4 categories (patents, utility models, trademarks, designs) and time\n\n\n    8\nNational Property Rights\nÖPA\n5 categories, several sublevels, time\n\n\n    9\nNational Property Rights\nÖPA/EPO\nTechnology fields (patents, utility models) and time\n\n\n    10\nProperty Rights EPO\nÖPA/EPO\nTechnology fields (patents) and time\n\n\n    11\nGreen Patents (Project 1, 1A [temporal development])\nEPO/OECD\nhierachical domains (green patents), origin of applicant, first publication date, NUTS\n\n\n    12\nGreen Patents (Project 2, 2A [temporal development])\nEPO/OECD\nsame as 11 + yearly total-publications for comparison\n\n\n    13\nFemale inventors and female researchers\nOECD/EPO\nWomen inventor's rate and female researchers - country comparison\n\n\n    14\nMitigation against climate change\nEPO\npatent areas (Y02-tags and weighting per document), first-applicant-country, time\n\n\n    15\nSurvey on low female inventor's rate - reasons\nÖPA\n7 main categories and different number of subcategories\n\n\n    16\nSurvey on  low female inventor rate -  characteristics of participants\nÖPA\ncharacteristics of persons participating at the survey\n\n\n    17\nWomen's inventor rate (WIR) - technical areas\nEPO\n5 technical areas, time, country comparisons\n\n\n    18\nWomen's inventor rate (WIR) -  regional perspective\nEPO\nNUTS2 regions, time, country perspective\n\n\n    19\nWomen's inventor rate (WIR) - residents and non-residents\nEPO\nresidents and non-residents, countries\n\n\n    20\nWomen's inventor rate (WIR) - development over time\nEPO\nTime and country comparison\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization Awards\nThe Austrian Patent Office will award the best three data visualizations.

This course focuses on data visualization techniques with reference to contemporary issues of economic policy. There will be coding sessions in class where students assemble plots in R and study the basics of data visualization. Students are required to recreate figures at home to improve their skills in coding. As a special feature, we will have a collaboration with the Austrian Patent Office. Students will gain insights into the evolution and dissemination of innovation in the economic system. The agency will exclusively provide internal data to create data visualizations and illustrate the process of private innovation in Austria. Students need to bring their laptop to class and should have prior knowledge of data handling in R (tidyr).\n\n   \n\nTo sum up, students will gain:\n\n\nan overview of contemporary debates in economic policy based on recent empirical research\na basic understanding of principles of data visualization and the use of figures in economic policy debates\nan opportunity to work with exclusive data from the Austrian Patent Office"

As the graphic illustration of statistical data gains in importance in both the academic and the public discourse, students will learn best practices and gain insights into visualization techniques. A large part of each session is dedicated to the work with data, where the lecturer provides R-code to produce figures in class.\nStudents are expected to recreate three charts at home at the beginning of the semester and create a comprehensive data visualization with exclusive data from the Austrian Patent Office. Studens will present their chart in class and draft a report with a detailed description of the data, the code and the final visualization in RMarkdown. Moreover, the best charts are awarded by the Austrian Patent Office.\nThe sessions are designed to encourage students to actively participate in the debates, raise questions, and gain experience in visualizing data for academic publications or the general debate.\n\n\nRecommended literature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Schwabish  Better Data Visualizations: A Guide for Scholars, Researchers, and Wonks  Columbia University Press  ISBN-13: 9780231193115  Link\n\nDavid Spiegelhalter  The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data  Penguin Books UK  ISBN-13: 9780241258767  Link\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nAfter completing this course, students will:\n\nknow key figures in various fields of economic policy and innovation economics\nshow improved programming skills in R and the ability to create a RMarkdown report\nhave basic knowledge of important principles of data visualization\nbe able to create charts to enrich their academic articles\n\n\n\nGrading\n\n\nAssignments: 30% (0-10 points for each visualization)\n\n\nChart presentation: 30% (0-20 points for the quality of the presentation, 0-10 for the preliminary chart)\n\n\nWritten report: 40% (0-40 points for the report and the final chart)\n\n\n\n\n   100-90: Excellent      89-80: Good      79-65: Satisfactory      64-50: Sufficient\n\nAll single tasks have to be passed (50% threshold each)."
